GeekTo5K
========

This is a sample chrome packaged app which works with a companion Android app.

This app shows off using:
* chrome.storage.sync
* chrome.syncFileSystem
* chrome.pushMessaging
* chrome.tts
* HTML5 Desktop Notifications (chrome.notifications were not supported on mac just yet)


The server component code and the Android app which sends the push messages via GCM can be found at this repo:

The Chrome Packaged app can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store here:
